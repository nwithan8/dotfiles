BashFTW is a generic set of helper functions, with the ability to load additional configurations

Once setup:
- .bashrc loads .bashrc.ftw (the installation process for BashFTW creates this link)
- .bashrc.ftw loads .bashrc.ftw.mac and .bashrc.ftw.linux for platform-specific implementations of functions
- .bashrc.ftw loads .bashrc.{USER} (in this case, .bashrc.nharris) for personal functions (this file needs to be made manually)
- .bashrc.nharris loads .bashrc.nharris.mac and .bashrc.nharris.linux for platform-specific implementations of personal functions
- .bashrc.nharris stores a list of BASHRC_GROUPS, which .bashrc.ftw loads as well
  - Examples, in .bashrc.nharris, "easypost" is an entry in BASHRC_GROUPS
  - .bashrc.ftw, after loading .bashrc.nharris, will read this list and load each .bashrc.{GROUP} file (i.e. .bashrc.easypost)
  - This allows group files to be separate from personal files (but only loaded via the personal file)
