Bash entry is a generic set of helper functions, with the ability to load additional configurations

Once setup:
- .bashrc (or .bash_profile) loads ._bashrc.entry
- ._bashrc.entry loads ._bashrc.entry.mac and .._bashrc.entry.linux for platform-specific implementations of functions
- ._bashrc.entry loads .bashrc.{USER} (in this case, .bashrc.nharris) for personal functions (this file needs to be made manually)
- .bashrc.nharris loads .bashrc.nharris.mac and .bashrc.nharris.linux for platform-specific implementations of personal functions
- .bashrc.nharris stores a list of BASHRC_GROUPS, which ._bashrc.entry loads as well
  - Examples, in .bashrc.nharris, "easypost" is an entry in BASHRC_GROUPS
  - ._bashrc.entry, after loading .bashrc.nharris, will read this list and load each .bashrc.{GROUP} file (i.e. .bashrc.easypost)
  - This allows group files to be separate from personal files (but only loaded via the personal file)
